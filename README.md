# Prototype Rover Design

Team ARES a team of 25 members were working together to build a prototype of Mars rover for URC 2019.
Accessed live location using GPS module. Integrated hardware and interfacing sensors with Arduino. Master-Slave communication between various modules and Raspberry Pi.
Using Lora RF Module to transmits onboard data to base station.
Fetching data from MPU9250- Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer values to get real world data Yaw, Pitch, Roll angles.....
For Wireless long range communication LoRa v1.4 using as it has long range low power and less bandwidth (cannot be used for trasmitting videos) data associated with (modules-DHT-22, sensors-MPUs communication-SPI prtocol) with 32 bit header can be trasmitted over the air
# Testing Lora Dragino Shield
