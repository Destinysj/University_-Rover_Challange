# Prototype Rover Design

Team ARES a team of 25 members were working together to build a prototype of rover for URC .
- Accessed live location using GPS module. Integrated hardware and interfacing sensors with Arduino. Master-Slave communication between various modules and Raspberry Pi.
- Fetching data from MPU9250- Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer values to get real world data Yaw, Pitch, Roll angles.....
- Using Lora 1276 v2.0 RF Module to transmits onboard sensor data to base station.
  For Wireless long range communication LoRa v2.0 using as it has long range low power and less bandwidth (cannot be used for trasmitting     videos) data associated with (modules-DHT-22, sensors-MPUs communication-SPI prtocol) with 32 bit header can be trasmitted over the air
# Testing Lora Dragino Shield
- Open source Liabrary 
- Lora Shild based on SX127/SX128 targets professional wireless sensor network application 
- Sensitive -148dBm
- Highly sensitive combined with Integrated +20 dBm power amplifier.
- IEE802.15.4g
- Exceptional phase, noise immunity, selectivity, linearity.
- # Bullet Proof - IIP3
